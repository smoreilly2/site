## When does the season start?

Practices generally start during mid April, weather permitting, and games usually start in the first week of May.

## How long does the season last?

The regular season ends at about the same time school ends in June. If you child chooses to try out for an All-Star team and is selected, she could be playing through July.

## What are the different age levels?

**U8 (8 and under, usually 1 & 2 Grade) softball:** At the Rookie softball level, players begin to refine their skills and learn how the game is played. The games are more structured, and traditional positions are played in the field. This is Coach pitch. The ball is a 10” RIF (reduced injury) softball. Each inning goes until the batting team scores four runs, or the fielding team makes three outs. Games are held to 90 minutes. A scorebook is kept. All players are in the batting order, and no player sits on the bench for two consecutive innings. Teams usually practice once a week, and play both home and away games. 

**10U (10 and under, usually 3 & 4 Grade) softball:** For softball players at this 9-10 level, most of the traditional softball rules are followed. Each inning goes until the batting team scores four runs, or the fielding team makes three outs. Games are six innings and usually run about an hour and a half. A scorebook is kept. Special rules include players who pitch are limited to three innings per game and six innings per week. All players are in the batting order, and every player must play at least two innings in the field. Softball players use an 11 inch ball, pitch from 35 feet, and cannot lead or steal. Teams usually practice once a week, and play both home and away games.

**12U (12 and under, usually 5 & 6 Grade) softball:** At this level, softball players use a 12 inch ball, pitch from 40 feet, and are allowed to steal. Halfway through the season, pitching rules are relaxed and player may pitch six innings in one game (but are still limited to six innings per week). All players must play at least two innings in the field, and come up to bat at least once a game. Teams usually practice once a week, and play both home and away games.

## How do I determine my child's age level?

The cutoff date for all softball levels is the last day of the previous year. For example, softball players who are 12 years old or younger on December 31st are eligible to play 12U the following spring.  Kids are able to play up in the each group, but, not down.  The parents can choose the level they feel would best fit, but, the ultimate decision will be up to the Softball Director.

## Do you hold tryouts?

Warner softball is recreational, so there are no tryouts for the regular season. Every player who signs up is placed on a team. Once the regular season ends, tryouts are used to select All-Star teams for players at the 9-10 level and above. These All-Star teams are comprised of players from several towns, not just Warner.

## How much playing time will my child get?

Warner softball is recreational, and all players will play in every game.

## Who makes the All-Star team?

Starting at 9-10 level, all players are eligible to try out for an All-Star team, which plays after the regular season ends. During a series of All-Star tryouts, players are evaluated based on their performance and attitudes, and an All-Star team is selected. The all-star experience offers more instruction, and practices may be held daily. The All-Star teams may compete throughout most of the summer. The All-Star teams include players from Weare, Henniker, Hillsborough, Bradford, New London and New Boston.

## How do I volunteer to be a coach?
